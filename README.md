WIP

This is very early draft and I plan to work on the project more.

 At the current stage, I will not be able to finish all the features for the project, and I know it will fail. I want to submit it, but I am afraid that I did to little to warrant resubmission. I will keep working on it till the last minute. For context - not an excuse - I received my initial ADHD diagnosis in Dec. I did not manage to get prescription from a doctor in Poland before Christmas nor proper documentation (I need one more visit, but my doctor was booked out). I am hoping that when I get medication I will be able to be more productive. Currently I am experiencing elevated anxiety and near panic attack state. I do not want to miss that chance and I want to finish the course, but in my current state I feel like I can't progress. I was thinking about writing to Student Care sooner, but I was afraid and I thought that I can power through it. So, I was putting that off and now it feels like it might be too late as the submission date is on the day you will be able to read it. I don't actually know what I want to achieve with this message. I am not sure if I need absolution, reassurance or scolding. I expect all three and dread them all as well.

I know that project is not complete and it is not modified by me enough. Though, I hope it will be enough to grant me a resubmission and time to polish it off.
